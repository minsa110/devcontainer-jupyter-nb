## Using this image

### Configuration

You can directly reference pre-built versions of `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` by using the `image` property in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` or updating the `FROM` statement in your own `Dockerfile` to the following. An example `Dockerfile` is included in this repository.

- `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/...`

Refer to [this guide](https://containers.dev/guide/dockerfile) for more details.

Alternatively, you can use the contents of `Dockerfile` to fully customize your container's contents or to build it for a container host architecture not supported by the image.

### Using Conda
This dev container and its associated image includes [the `conda` package manager](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/conda/about). Additional packages installed using Conda will be downloaded from Anaconda or another repository if you configure one. To reconfigure Conda in this container to access an alternative repository, please see information on [configuring Conda channels here](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/conda/channel-setup).

Access to the Anaconda repository is covered by the [Anaconda Terms of Service](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/conda/terms), which may require some organizations to obtain a commercial license from Anaconda. **However**, when this dev container or its associated image is used with GitHub Codespaces or GitHub Actions, **all users are permitted** to use the Anaconda Repository through the service, including organizations normally required by Anaconda to obtain a paid license for commercial activities. Note that third-party packages may be licensed by their publishers in ways that impact your intellectual property, and are used at your own risk.

#### Installing Node.js

Given JavaScript front-end web client code written for use in conjunction with a Python back-end often requires the use of Node.js-based utilities to build, you can use a [Node feature](https://github.com/devcontainers/features/tree/main/src/node) to install any version of Node by adding the following to `devcontainer.json`:

```json
{
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/node:1": {
      "version": "latest"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Installing or updating Python utilities

This container installs all Python development utilities using [pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/) to avoid impacting the global Python environment. You can use this same utility add additional utilities in an isolated environment. For example:

```bash
pipx install prospector
```

Note that if you change the version of Python from the default, you'll need to run a few commands to update the utilities and `pipx`. More on that next.

#### Installing a different version of Python

As covered in the [user FAQ](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/faq) for Anaconda, you can install different versions of Python than the one in this image by running the following from a terminal:

```bash
conda install python=3.6
pip install --no-cache-dir pipx
pipx uninstall pipx
pipx reinstall-all
```

Or in a Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
RUN conda install -y python=3.6 \
    && pip install --no-cache-dir pipx \
    && pipx uninstall pipx \
    && pipx reinstall-all
```

See the [pipx documentation](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/docs/) for additional information.

#### [Optional] Using the forwardPorts property

By default, frameworks like Flask only listens to localhost inside the container. As a result, we recommend using the `forwardPorts` property (available in v0.98.0+) to make these ports available locally.

```json
"forwardPorts": [5000]
```

The `appPort` property [publishes](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/#published-ports) rather than forwards the port, so applications need to listen to `*` or `0.0.0.0` for the application to be accessible externally. This conflicts with the defaults of some Python frameworks, but fortunately the `forwardPorts` property does not have this limitation.

### [Optional] Adding the contents of environment.yml to the image

For convenience, this image will automatically install dependencies from the `environment.yml` file in the parent folder when the container is built. You can change this behavior by altering this line in the `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
RUN if [ -f "/tmp/conda-tmp/environment.yml" ]; then /opt/conda/bin/conda env update -n base -f /tmp/conda-tmp/environment.yml; fi \
    && rm -rf /tmp/conda-tmp
```

### [Optional] Adding the contents of reqeuirements.txt to the image

This image is intended to be used with conda environments, but if your repo contains `requirements.txt`, you can pip install additional dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file in the `postcreate.sh`:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
